Hey there! I'm Shweta 🌟, your go-to geek 🤓 at the intersection of stories, data, and play. Currently, in my third whirlwind year as a Computational Media Ph.D. student at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

Before I put on my academic hat, I was out there in the wild, crunching numbers and unraveling data mysteries 🕵️‍♀️ as a Data Science Analyst at Accenture. But hey, that was just the prologue to my story.

Now, I'm deep in the game 🎮—literally! I'm exploring the cool and complex dance between players and stories within interactive narrative environments. Think of me as part wizard, part storyteller, crafting spellbinding visualizations 🌈 and narratives that pull you right into the data-driven drama.

From being a data analyst ninja 🥷 to leading projects, coding up a storm, and even dabbling in qualitative coding, my journey's been anything but linear. It's a tale of adaptation, learning, and, most importantly, fun!
